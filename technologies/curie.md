While Fleming and Nightingale together already comprise a health information platform model on their own, Hippocrades also seeks to make this solution accessible not just to the information technology industry at large, but all the way down to the grassroots level: actual players in the healthcare industry (doctors, patients, clinics, health facilities).

As such, the entry point to Hippocrades does not stop at RPC endpoints and APIs. A complete health facility information system has also been built using Fleming as a backend. This information system, implemented as a set of web applications, is collectively known as Curie.

Curie uses modular design in order to expose its complete set of modules and features (e.g. Registration and Queueing, Electronic Medical Records, Billing, Inventory, Laboratory and Radiology, Ward Management) into products fit for different health facilities:

* An electronic medical records system for individual doctors
* A clinic management system for outpatient clinics
* A laboratory information system and/or a radiology information system for diagnostic centers
* A hospital management system for hospitals
* A pharmacy management system for drugstores and pharmacies

Curie makes it possible for health facilities to digitize their operations, all while automatically connecting to Hippocrades and enjoying the benefits of interoperability and privacy.

## Self-Managed Setup <a href="#self-managed-setup" id="self-managed-setup"></a>

Any health facility or care provider can easily sign up for an account and even create its own self-managed MongoDB database in Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure. With Curie, a user can easily enable the system to participate and be integrated with the Nightingale blockchain network via the Fleming interface (see diagram). In doing so, this ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.

Curie is ideal for those care providers that are still not using EMR/EHR systems. Likewise, it is also good for those who want to upgrade their existing systems and be compliant with regulations.

## Status: DONE <a href="#status-done" id="status-done"></a>

Curie is already existing and functional. It is already deployed and being used by health facilities and care professionals via a partnership with a provider called [MYCURE](https://www.mycure.md).
