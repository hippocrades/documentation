# Conclusion

We have proposed Hippocrades’ infrastructure, with healthcare applications and comprehensive APIs, that developers and health providers can use to enhance their systems — making them interoperable while being compliant and secure. In addition, it could also make their systems Web3.0 integratable taking advantage of what blockchain and zero-knowledge can do. Furthermore, this platform can also be used as a permissionless health information exchange that would accelerate important transfer of health information without having to risk data privacy.

In the finance world, blockchain has already driven a significant number of tech startups creating innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) apps. In healthcare, however, there is little progress for blockchain-based apps, relative to that of finance’. This is quite ironic considering healthcare is dealing with tons of sensitive, private, and personal data, which is actually the ideal use case for the application of the said technologies.

Hippocrades architecture is designed so that more DeHealth (Decentralized Health) apps would come into fruition. Instead of worrying about security, compliance, interoperability, and decentralization, developers can just build on top of Hippocrades’ platform and focus on the core feature of the product they are building.

The core tech of Hippocrades - Curie, Fleming, and Nightingale, are not just concepts, they are already existing. Specifically, the first two (Curie and Fleming) are already built and in production. The team has started building them since 2016 and has made significant improvements in the last 5 years. On the other hand, Nightingale’s POC (proof of concept) is also already built and in the initial testing phase.

Together, Hippocrades' three products can unlock major use cases in the healthcare sector that previously were not possible or would have limitations. This would bring widespread convenience and efficiency in the ecosystem from healthcare providers to doctors, to patients, to pharmacies, to insurance companies, to research institutions, and to government units.

With a DAO setup, we can have a truly decentralized health infrastructure paving the way to finally reach the holy grail of health data exchange that has long eluded the industry.
