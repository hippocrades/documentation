# Introduction

Many studies have shown the enormous benefits of having a Health Information Exchange (HIE) - from the improvement in the quality of care, better healthcare delivery, increased safety, elimination of duplicate testing, to the reduction of healthcare costs.

An HIE allows the exchange of healthcare information electronically from one organization to another among different information systems. The demand for this is growing along with nationwide efforts to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of health care delivery. The supposedly efficient, timely, and safe access and retrieval of health data bring about the many advantages of having such a platform.

In the US, meaningful use requirements, new payment approaches that stress care coordination, and federal financial incentives drive the interest and demand for health information exchange.

For many countries, especially the emerging ones, implementing an HIE is still a far cry from reality. This is because of the many significant challenges in building one, such as standardizations, at-scale interoperability, data security, data privacy, data integrity, identity assurance, risk management, and auditability. Even for developed countries that have taken big steps toward this direction, there are still ongoing obstacles in achieving the intended setup.

Simply put, having a decentralized, secure and permissionless Health Information Exchange (HIE) platform has always been quite an impossible goal. Most, if not all, of the existing HIEs now, while functional, still have not fully addressed the security and trust concerns. On top of this, there are apprehensions of private data being managed on a centralized platform by a single organization.

### HIE in Blockchain

The advent of Blockchain technology has brought much potential to stamping out these challenges. In 2016, different whitepapers were submitted in the Healthcare Blockchain Challenge 3 by the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). The papers were from reputable organizations that provided sound concepts and ideas on the uses and benefits of blockchain and how it can be integrated in achieving a decentralized healthcare infrastructure.

It was emphasized that blockchain technology would change the model for engaging with and governing a Health Information Exchange giving patients more control over their healthcare information. 4 And since records are guaranteed to be cryptographically secure, there is no possibility of bad actors threatening data integrity. Fraud and abuse are reduced with blockchain-timestamped protocols and blockchain-enabled traceability and accountability allowing health providers to share networks without compromising data privacy, security, and integrity.

In addition, a blockchain-powered health information exchange could unlock the true value of interoperability. In this interoperable blockchain, smart contracts can be created to a Hub as the gateway to store standardized information, which can be immediately accessible to all organizations allowed by the blockchain. This can be accomplished by creating an application program interface (API) oriented architecture to feed the smart contract. The APIs will be published and made available to all participating organizations connected to the blockchain – enabling frictionless integration with each organization’s existing systems.

Capitalizing on this technology has the potential to connect fragmented systems to generate insights and to better assess the value of care. In the long term, a nationwide blockchain network may improve efficiencies and support better health outcomes for patients.

Indeed, there is no lack of literature pointing out the numerous opportunities of blockchain in healthcare. Concepts including frameworks have been provided on how it can be set up.

Today, while there have been attempts to implement these ideas, an effective, decentralized, secure, trustless HIE platform and healthcare infrastructure have yet to emerge. This is primarily because of the limitations that decentralized ledgers supporting rich applications create: scalability, privacy, and auditability.

Fortunately, a cryptography method that has found its way to blockchain, called _Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proof_, a protocol, where prover (A) can prove that A knows information X to a verifier (B) without sharing any other knowledge to B other than that A knows X.

Popularized and deployed by the likes of Zcash, this indeed may be the missing piece to address these concerns and finally fully optimize blockchain’s potential.

### Health Infrastructure

As an important aside, designing and building this decentralized HIE is only a part of the pie, albeit a big one at that. It necessitates looking at the macro view of the ecosystem’s healthcare infrastructure in general. This is to discover if there are other gaps in the processes that need to be addressed. The sector is a deluge of different markets with varying needs resulting in numerous providers creating independent solutions to these differing requirements.

First, the availability and effectiveness of Health Information Systems and solutions (such as Electronic Health Records or EHR) used by the health facilities are in various stages. Many are still using old technologies that are neither interoperable nor compliant with today’s standards. Some health facilities do not even have their own EHR applications while some use systems that lack important modules and functionalities. Second, all these health information systems, as they integrate with the HIE, should comply with standards so as not to compromise security, privacy, and auditability. Currently, not all industry-set standards are met.

Furthermore, the main point of having an HIE is to centralize the exchange of transactions, but aggregating all these under one platform and organization does not lead to a decentralized approach. Why? Because of the hesitation and resistance of giving this responsibility to one single entity. There are trust issues with providers, transparency and integrity of the application, and the potential vulnerability to attacks.

### Hippocrades in a Nutshell

To resolve the above-mentioned concerns, Hippocrades will be utilizing these two amazing technologies - the blockchain and zero-knowledge. The combination of this powerful duo and integrating them into Hippocrades’ existing health-tech platform could ultimately address the dilemma the healthcare industry has long been wanting to solve.

Hippocrades’ tech which has been in constant development and improvements since 2016, includes comprehensive front-end solutions like Electronic Health Records or EHR systems (_**CURIE**_, status: done), Healthcare API endpoints (_**FLEMING**_, status: done), and its HIE Blockchain (_**NIGHTINGALE**_, status: POC done) which acts as a ‘smart contract’ for health data exchanges.

As a logical extension, Hippocrades will implement the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) model so that the dream of having a truly decentralized, secure, and trusted healthcare infrastructure will finally come to fruition.
