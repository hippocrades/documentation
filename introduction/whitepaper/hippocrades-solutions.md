Hippocrades is exposed as a set of comprehensive healthcare APIs covering crucial medical information such as patients, medical records, diagnostic test results, and so on. These APIs collectively form Fleming.

Fleming APIs have been developed to form the backbone of health-tech products for doctors, clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health facilities, capturing important business logic cross-connecting all these different sources of medical information with each other.

These APIs are exposed as well-documented REST endpoints, promoting interoperability with any modern information system. Even legacy information systems may connect to Fleming and begin storing on the Health Information Exchange by developing a thin REST client layer on top of their existing architecture, driving the potential for market acceptance even higher.
