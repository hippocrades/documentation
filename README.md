## What Hippocrades is solving?

**Abstract**. With different providers and diverse markets, healthcare solutions have become increasingly fragmented. Thus, a truly _decentralized_, _secure_, and _permissionless_ Healthcare Infrastructure continues to be a holy grail in the healthcare ecosystem. The pursuit of data privacy and security, which are of utmost importance, is also what makes it very difficult and challenging to make data more interoperable and shareable across different providers.

Over the last few years, there were experimental attempts to address this concern using blockchain technology. However, blockchain, despite showing potential, still falls short given its limitation on scalability, privacy, and auditability. If every healthcare transaction is placed in the chain, for example, this will be resource-intensive. Furthermore, blockchainâ€™s â€˜transparent, anyone can seeâ€™ setup becomes a liability to some degree as data privacy can never be compromised at any rate. Simply put, blockchain needs an additional element to optimize its power.

We propose Hippocrades â€” a solution that intends to finally resolve this dilemma. First, by adding a zero-knowledge proof cryptographic protocol on top of blockchain: addressing security, privacy, and scalability. Second, by providing healthcare applications and tech infrastructure designed for Web 3.0: any health system providers can easily utilize to create or augment their existing solutions making them secure, compliant, interoperable, and integrable in the blockchain. Third, by setting it up as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO): governed by set rules in a smart contract that is transparent and controlled by the organization members.

Hippocrades is beyond just a concept. Its three (3) technologies are already existing and will be presented in this paper.
