# 👴 Hippocrades

### In a Nutshell <a href="#in-a-nutshell" id="in-a-nutshell"></a>

HIPPOCRADES is short for Health Infrastructure and Private Protocol On Chain with Ready-to-use Applications in a Decentralized Environment and Setup.

Hippocrades is the Web 3.0 infrastructure and protocol for health information. Its primary purpose is to be a platform for interoperability and health data exchange among different information systems. To reach this desired but elusive goal however, it requires an infrastructure of (1) health applications and (2) a comprehensive set of secured APIs even before attempting to put together a blockchain protocol for it.

These are necessary solutions, without them, onboarding in the blockchain will have extreme challenges. Thus, a lot of blockchain tech startups are not able to reach their full potential as they primarily focus on building their blockchain apps with little consideration to addressing the other gaps.

### Two Facets <a href="#two-facets" id="two-facets"></a>

Hippocrades seeks to address two important facets of being a platform for health information:

Privacy. Because Hippocrades deals in health information, a top concern is privacy – to what extent must we allow a patient’s information to be revealed and shared among parties? in order to succeed in providing that patient with the healthcare they need?

Interoperability. The most significant barrier today to efficient health information is that health information is highly fragmented. Health information is either kept manually on paper or digitized in disparate information systems (in practice, even two health facilities next door to each other are likely to have separate, wildly incompatible databases!).

Additionally, what connects Hippocrades to the real world is its goal of accessibility. Hippocrades seeks to provide a solution for the above problems of interoperability and privacy, while at the same time making it concretely applicable to clinics, hospitals, and health facilities in their day-to-day operations.

### Hippocrades Approach <a href="#hippocrades-approach" id="hippocrades-approach"></a>

Hippocrades provides three (3) major components to fill the gaps in building the decentralized healthcare infrastructure.

Fleming, NightIngale, and Curie comprise Hippocrades’ advanced solutions and comprehensive API services to address different healthcare needs making systems compliant and interoperable while protecting and securing sensitive personal health records.

While this may sound grandiose and far-fetched considering the amount of time needed for development work, the next section would show that a significant part of the Hippocrades setup is already existing and in place.
